	<LongDescription>
Love the new subway station added with Detailer's Patch #1 but wanted to use them for trains instead?
Well now you can.

# Elevated Train Station
Includes 2 elevated train stations and 1 network for the station.
* It is recommended to use two separate one-way single tracks to connect to the Small Elevated Train Station for maximum beautification.

# DISCLAIMER
* Safe to remove. This mod will not break your save if removed.
* This mod requires ***Asset Packs Manager*** which is highly experimental. This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that require this without the dependency will pop up errors. Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save. But either way, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage. Contact me on Discord and I'll try to help you recover anyway.
